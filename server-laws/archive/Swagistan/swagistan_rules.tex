\subsection{Validity}

	\item The server administration reserves the right to change these rules at any time.
	\item \textit{discontinued}
	\item The rules only come into force as soon as they are published in the rules text channel. Accordingly, no rule shall apply retroactively.
	\item Lacking or faulty knowledge of the server regulations does not grant legal immunity, as informing oneself about the current legal situation of the server is obligatory.
	\item Likewise, in case of ambiguity, one must contact the person in charge.
	\item If one of the provisions violates the constitution of the country of a person concerned, only the illegal passage is repealed for that person\footnote{salvatory clause}.	
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Second Accounts}
You have to mark secondary accounts as such. To do this, you have to edit your server profile in such a way that it is possible for everyone to see whose secondary account it is on the basis of this profile.

\subsection{Sentence}
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
	\item A distinction is generally made between three penalties:
	\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
		\item A warning is a preliminary stage to actual punitive measures. Each member receives a warning for minor offences.
		\item A timeout refers to a temporary exclusion from the server.
		\item A permanent ban is an irrevocable, indefinite exclusion from the server.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item The penalty is rarely assessed according to the severity of the offence, but mostly according to the following:
	\begin{enumerate}[1.]
		\item First warning
		\item Second warning
		\item 24-hour timeout
		\item One-week timeout
		\item One\-month timeout
		\item 1-year timeout
		\item Permanent ban
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Any penalty must be revoked without exception if the punished person can prove the illegality of the penalty.
	\item Unlawfulness exists if the act in question is not an offence on the part of the punished person, if paragraphs 1 and 2 were violated in the punishment or if the act was wrongly classified as an offence of particular gravity.
	\item If the offence is a serious offence, an immediate timeout up to an immediate permanent ban may be imposed depending on the seriousness of the offence. The assessment of the severity is subject to the responsible person, but must be comprehensible. 
	\item If there is any doubt, the judgement may be overturned by the President of the Supreme Court or by a qualified majority vote of the Board and reversed or converted to another penalty.
	\item Any unlawful messages must be stored temporarily in the form of a screenshot until the beginning of the week after next, so that in case of doubt the unlawfulness can be challenged \footnote{This is due to past difficulties in assessing the unlawfulness of statements in retrospect}, after which one can apply to the Board for a deletion, which however must be confirmed by a qualified majority.
    \item After each timeout, the severity of the offence increases in such a way that the first offence after a timeout according to the penalty hierarchy from paragraph 2 number 1 \- 7 is increased due to its severity in relation to the previous basic penalty \footnote{The first penalty after a timeout, respectively the total first penalty.}.
	\item Permanent bans are partly excluded from paragraph 8. These shall only be imposed in cases of extreme severity or where paragraph 8 applies, unless there is an acute improvement in behaviour and the Board votes in favour by a simple majority.
	\item It is not permitted to unban people from the server contrary to the express permission of the President of the Supreme Court. This is considered a punishable offence and will be punished with a timeout regardless of the position in the punishment hierarchy as interpreted in accordance with paragraph 8. The unlawfully unbanned person shall also be banned immediately.
	\item $^{1}$Infractions of particular severity by members of a division will result in permanent expulsion from that and other divisions. $^{2}$This rule does not apply to $jaap\_stam$, $robertogmor$ and $the.god.emperor$ and their secondary accounts.
	\item Complicity, aiding and abetting, incitement and attempt are punished equivalently.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Holder}

\section{Minecraft-Server}

\subsection{Application}
The acts of this section shall only apply when the PR Swagistan holds any server.

\subsection{Guarantee}
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
	\item Only persons for whom someone can be proved to be a guarantor may be placed on the whitelist.
	\item If a person commits a violation of particular severity, he/she will be banned from the server along with the guarantor.
	\item If a guarantor is banned from the server, this is done equally to those for whom the guarantor stands surety.
	\item Guarantees cannot be withdrawn afterwards.
	\item The administration is exempted from paragraph 2f.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Legal separation}
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
	\item The server right shall be clearly distinguished from the internal right situation on the offshoots of The God Complex Server.
	\item Internal law refers to constitutions and rules, such as faction-owned legal texts, that are not recognised by the proprietorship in its function as a proprietary assembly.
	\item The inspection and use of server data and other information accessible only to the administration, such as player data or logs, which are superior to internal regulations, may not be used as evidence for trials and the like which are not carried out by the Supreme Server Court in its function\footnote{For example, in-game murders may not be proven via logs}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Basic rules}
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
	\item The Minecraft server right is subject to the Discord server right.
	\item It is forbidden to resort to methods that give an advantage over other players, regardless of whether they use the method or not, that are not generally recognised as fair.
	\item Any behaviour not affected by such methods is not punishable.
	\item On the Minecraft server, one must behave according to the respective Discord server rules.
	\item The general server law does not differentiate between factions, which is why this is merely an internal organisation that is not covered by any server-wide laws and thus crimes against them in detail cannot be subject to server-wide judgements.
	\item 3 only applies if the offences are not against the rules of the Discord server or para 1f.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Factions}
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
    \item A faction is any grouping with more than one player.
	\item The term player is not synonymous with the term Minecraft account and therefore does not warrant creation if the other account is a secondary account of the person.
	\item Factions have the right to their own category in which they can create any channels upon request.
	\item The moderation may reject such requests unless they can establish a justifiable reason for setting them up.
	\item Due to the activity and tasks of the moderation, the moderation is entitled to look into the channels at any time in order to be able to identify violations of the applicable law.
	\item Each parliamentary group is granted its own role, the purpose of which is to ensure that these channels cannot be viewed by members of other parliamentary groups.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Specific server law}
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
    \item It is forbidden to destroy places that are a place of knowledge.
	\item Paragraph 1 may only be broken if a faction exploits this rule to gain an advantage.
	\item Each faction must claim a territory when it is established.
	\item This territory must consist of an above-ground biome and may not initially extend beyond its boundaries.
	\item Only materials originating from this territory or acquired from others may be used.
	\item One may extend one's territory to a neighbouring biome with each extension announced server-wide by the administration according to par. 3ff.
	\item Different variants of a biome are not considered to be its own biome.
\end{enumerate}
