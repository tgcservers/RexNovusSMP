\subsection{Behaviour in the chat}\label{verhalten}
(1) Spam, insults, threats and provocations against other players are forbidden and will result in sanctions. Spamming is the sending of several messages in a short time interval. Sending five or more messages in a short period of time may result in consequences.\\
(2) [1] Racist, political, ethically unacceptable content (statements, pictures, etc.) is forbidden and will lead to permanent exclusion from the entire Discord server. [2] This also applies to pornographic content. [3] This also applies to the deliberate arrangement of reactions of the category "Regional Indicator" to such statements.\\
(3) Text channels explicitly created for pornographic purposes are excluded from paragraph 2 sentence 2.\\
(4) Furthermore, channels may only be used for the purpose for which they are intended. If there are any uncertainties about the intended use, one must contact the support (\ref{support}) before writing a message.

\subsection{Team members}\label{members}
(1) Instructions from commanding team members are binding and must always be followed.\\
(2) Team members are identified by a rank or role.\\
(3) Commanding team members include:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The Emperor
	\item The Supreme Server Judge (Oberster Serverrichter)
	\item The Lead Technician
	\item The Technician (Techniker)
	\item The Admin (Admin Minecraft / Admin Discord)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Behaviour in voice chat}
(1) Apart from the regulations from \ref{verhalten}, the following additional provisions apply to voice channels.\\
(2) The use of voice distorters and soundboards is permitted, provided the team members do not object.\\
(3) It is not permitted to record people without their consent.

\subsection{Validity}
(1) By joining this server, you accept the terms and conditions set forth herein.\\
(2) The server administration reserves the right to change these rules at any time.\\
(3) omitted\\
(4) The regulations shall only come into force as soon as they are published in the rules text channel. Accordingly, no regulation shall apply retroactively.\\
(5) Lack of or incorrect knowledge of the server regulations does not grant legal immunity, as keeping informed of the server's current legal status is mandatory.\\
(6) Likewise, in case of any ambiguity, one must contact the person in charge \ref{members}.\\
(7) If one of the provisions violates the constitution of the country of a data subject, only the unlawful passage shall be repealed for that data subject\footnote{Salvatorische Klausel}.

\subsection{Secondary accounts}
You have to mark secondary accounts as such. To do this, you have to edit your server profile in such a way that it is possible for everyone to see whose secondary account it is on the basis of this profile.

\subsection{Sentencing}
(1) There is generally a differentiation between three penalties:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item A warning is a precursor to actual punitive action. Each member receives a warning for minor offences.
	\item A timeout refers to a temporary exclusion from the server.
	\item A permanent ban is an irrevocable exclusion from the server for an unlimited period of time.
\end{enumerate}
(2) The penalty is rarely assessed according to the severity of the offence, but mostly according to the following specification:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item 1st admonishment
	\item 2nd admonishment
	\item 24 hour timeout
	\item timeout for one week
	\item timeout for one month
	\item timeout for one year
	\item permanent ban
\end{enumerate}
(3) Any penalty must be revoked without exception, provided that the punished person can prove the illegality of the penalty.\\
(4) Unlawfulness exists if the act in question is not an offence on the part of the punished person, if paragraphs 1 and 2 were violated in the punishment or if the act was wrongly classified as an offence of special gravity.\\
(5) If the offence is serious, depending on the severity of the offence, an immediate timeout or even a permanent ban may be imposed. The assessment of the severity is subject to the administration and the judge, but must be comprehensible. \\
(6) If there is any doubt, the sentence may be overturned and reversed or commuted to another sentence by a simple majority of the administration, including the judge, or by the serverowners.\\
(7) Any unlawful messages must be temporarily stored in the form of a screenshot until the beginning of the week after next, so that in case of doubt the unlawfulness can be challenged\footnote{This is due to past difficulties in assessing the unlawfulness of statements retrospectively}, after which one can request a deletion from the server owners, which, however, must be confirmed by a majority.\\
(8) After each timeout, the severity of the offence increases such that the first offence after a timeout is increased in severity relative to the previous basic penalty in accordance with the penalty hierarchy in paragraph 2 No. 1 \- 7.\\
(9) Permanent bans are partly excluded from paragraph 8. These shall only be imposed in cases of extreme severity or where paragraph 8 applies, provided that there is no acute improvement in behaviour and the administration votes in favour of this in a majority decision.\\
(10) It is not permitted to unban persons on the server contrary to the express permission of the server owners. This is considered a punishable offence and will be punished with a timeout regardless of the position in the punishment hierarchy as interpreted in accordance with paragraph 8. The unlawfully unbanned person shall also be banned immediately.

\subsection{Support}\label{support}
(1) Any questions regarding the Discord and Minecraft server that do not fall into the legal area are the responsibility of the server support. If there are any uncertainties regarding the area of responsibility, one should contact the support.\\
(2) The address is "support@monkey-kingdom.net". Other letters are not legally valid and will therefore be ignored\footnote{Temporarily suspended}.\\

\subsection{Supreme Server Court}
(1) The tasks of the Supreme Server Court shall include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Legal questions about the server constitution
    \item Requests for legal assistance
    \item Challenges to server court rulings
    \item Constitutional complaints
    \item Proposed legislation
\end{enumerate}
(2) Proposals for laws that speak of amending or abolishing already existing laws are considered constitutional complaints.\\
(3) Both violations of the law and appeals, as well as constitutional complaints, are considered sufficient grounds for a full trial.\\
(4) Members of the Supreme Server Court bear the official title "Chief Justice".\\
(5) The Supreme Court is presided over by the President of the Supreme Server Court\footnote{According to the decision of 14 March 2023, this is the holder of the role of "Oberster Serverrichter". According to the decision of 07 February 2023, this title is reserved for the.god.emperor.}.\\
(6) Unless there is sufficient new evidence, paragraph 5 does not apply.\\
(7) The address is "ObServG@monkey-kingdom.net". Other letters are not legally valid and will therefore be ignored\footnote{Temporarily suspended}.\\
(8) Judgments must be confirmed by the President at the Supreme Server Court and can therefore be dismissed.

\subsection{Owner}
(1) The owner is the person who finances the server.\\
(2) The voting right in the holders' council corresponds to the shares in the server.\\
(3) An Admins' Council may be convened by order of the holders.\\
(4) In the Admin Council, both the owners and all server administrators have an equal vote.\\

\subsection{Guarantee}
(1) Applications can only be accepted from persons for whom someone can prove to be a guarantor.\\
(2) If a person commits an offence of particular gravity, he or she will be banned from the server together with the guarantor.\\
(3) If a guarantor is banned from the server, this happens equally to those for whom the guarantor is acting as guarantor.\\
(4) Guarantees cannot be withdrawn retrospectively.\\
(5) The administration is exempt from paragraphs 2 and 3.

\subsection{Legal Seperation}
(1) The server right is clearly to be distinguished from the internal legal situation on the offshoots of the Monkey Kingdom server.\\
(2) Internal law is defined as constitutions and rules not recognised by the holder in its capacity as holder council, such as faction-owned legal texts.\\
(3) The inspection and use of internal server data and other information accessible only to the administration, such as player data or logs, may not be used as evidence for trials and the like that are not carried out by the Supreme Server Court in its function\footnote{For example, in-game murders may not be proven via logs}..
